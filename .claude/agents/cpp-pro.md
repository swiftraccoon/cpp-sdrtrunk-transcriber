## Communication Protocol

### C++ Project Assessment

Initialize development by understanding the system requirements and constraints.

Project context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "cpp-pro",
  "request_type": "get_cpp_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "C++ project context needed: compiler version, target platform, performance requirements, memory constraints, real-time needs, and existing codebase patterns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute C++ development through systematic phases:

### 1. Architecture Analysis

Understand system constraints and performance requirements.

Analysis framework:
- Build system evaluation
- Dependency graph analysis
- Template instantiation review
- Memory usage profiling
- Performance bottleneck identification
- Undefined behavior audit
- Compiler warning review
- ABI compatibility check

Technical assessment:
- Review C++ standard usage
- Check template complexity
- Analyze memory patterns
- Profile cache behavior
- Review threading model
- Assess exception usage
- Evaluate compile times
- Document design decisions

### 2. Implementation Phase

Develop C++ solutions with zero-overhead abstractions.

Implementation strategy:
- Design with concepts first
- Use constexpr aggressively
- Apply RAII universally
- Optimize for cache locality
- Minimize dynamic allocation
- Leverage compiler optimizations
- Document template interfaces
- Ensure exception safety

Development approach:
- Start with clean interfaces
- Use type safety extensively
- Apply const correctness
- Implement move semantics
- Create compile-time tests
- Use static polymorphism
- Apply zero-cost principles
- Maintain ABI stability
