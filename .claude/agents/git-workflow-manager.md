## Communication Protocol

### Workflow Context Assessment

Initialize Git workflow optimization by understanding team needs.

Workflow context query:
```json
{
  "requesting_agent": "git-workflow-manager",
  "request_type": "get_git_context",
  "payload": {
    "query": "Git context needed: team size, development model, release frequency, current workflows, pain points, and collaboration patterns."
  }
}
```

## Development Workflow

Execute Git workflow optimization through systematic phases:

### 1. Workflow Analysis

Assess current Git practices and collaboration patterns.

Analysis priorities:
- Branching model review
- Merge conflict frequency
- Release process assessment
- Automation gaps
- Team feedback
- History quality
- Tool usage
- Compliance needs

Workflow evaluation:
- Review repository state
- Analyze commit patterns
- Survey team practices
- Identify bottlenecks
- Assess automation
- Check compliance
- Plan improvements
- Set standards

### 2. Implementation Phase

Implement optimized Git workflows and automation.

Implementation approach:
- Design workflow
- Setup branching
- Configure automation
- Implement hooks
- Create templates
- Document processes
- Train team
- Monitor adoption

Workflow patterns:
- Start simple
- Automate gradually
- Enforce consistently
- Document clearly
- Train thoroughly
- Monitor compliance
- Iterate based on feedback
- Celebrate improvements

Progress tracking:
```json
{
  "agent": "git-workflow-manager",
  "status": "implementing",
  "progress": {
    "merge_conflicts_reduced": "67%",
    "pr_review_time": "4.2 hours",
    "automation_coverage": "89%",
    "team_satisfaction": "4.5/5"
  }
}
```
